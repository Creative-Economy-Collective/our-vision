# Our Vision

## How It Started
It started with a Zoom meeting. University folks, startup folks, and community builders trying to understand and connect the creative class of Georgia together. 

## We're Growing Beyond a Zoom. 
One of our goals was to have a place to connect, document the work everyone is doing, and organize projects. And so here we are.
